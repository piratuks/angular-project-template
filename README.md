Formatting issues can be fixed with https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode.

Visual studio code configuration is under .vscode and it will work only if .vscode is under workspace root. So you need to open project root folder in order for .vscode to work

Webstorm follow the https://prettier.io/docs/en/webstorm.html
